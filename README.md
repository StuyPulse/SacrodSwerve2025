# Sacrod Swerve Project

## Summary
Project for a swerve drive with 8 NEO motors for both turning and driving, as well as a NavX gyro for its odometry. The drivetrain will be used for various tests during the prototyping phase of the 2025 season. Most importantly, it will be used to teach SE newbies the basic functionality of swerve drive and odometry systems and how they are controlled.
